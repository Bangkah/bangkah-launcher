# Bangkah v1.0.4 Release Notes

Release Date: December 15, 2025

Focus: Publish cleanup for leaner distribution on GitHub/Packagist.

Highlights:
- Add `.gitattributes` at repo and package level to exclude non-essential files (docs, tests, backups, dev scripts) from source archives.
- Remove dev-only dependency from package `composer.json`.
- No functional code changes; runtime behavior unchanged from v1.0.3.
