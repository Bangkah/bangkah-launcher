## [1.0.5] - 2026-03-15

### Fixed
- Restored `bangkah:create` command availability in Laravel launcher project.
- Ensured Bangkah package dependency and provider wiring are registered correctly for local launcher usage.
- Stabilized feature tests by removing runtime dependency on built Vite manifest during test execution.

### Changed
- Cleaned repository structure by removing tracked duplicate sandbox copies under `home/` and `tmp/`.
- Added repository hygiene rules in `.gitignore` for workspace-only artifacts and route backup files.
- Added `docs/PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md` to document expected folder layout and cleanup practices.

### Verification
- `php artisan list bangkah` shows `bangkah:create`.
- `php artisan bangkah:create --help` executes successfully.
- `php artisan test` passes.

## [1.0.1] - 2025-12-15

### Fixed
- Added `exclude-from-classmap` to prevent ambiguous class resolution warnings
- Ensures clean package distribution without monorepo artifacts
- Fixes "There are no commands defined in the 'bangkah' namespace" error

### Technical
- Package now properly excludes `/app/`, `/database/`, `/bootstrap/`, `/config/`, `/public/`, `/resources/`, `/routes/`, `/storage/`, `/tests/`, `/vendor/` from classmap generation
- Clean subtree tagging ensures only package files are distributed
